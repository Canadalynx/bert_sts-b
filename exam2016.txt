However, in recent years, opera has been facing serious challenges. The causes of some of these are beyond its control. One current challenge to opera is economic. The current world economic slowdown has meant that less money raises the broader question of how much should be pain to support opera singers and other artists. Society seems to accept the large salaries paid to business managers and the multi-million-dollar contracts given to sports athletes. But what about opera singers? Somehow, people have the idea that artists can be creative only if they suffer in poverty, but this is unrealistic: If artists, including opera singers, lack the support they need, valuable talent is wasted. ||| Effect of world finance on opera

Another problem faced by opera is how to meet the demands of audiences who are influenced by popular entertainment. Pop singers are often judged as much on the basis of how they look as how they sound. Therefore, opera singers, performing to audiences influenced by this popular culture, are now expected to be "models who sing." These demands may be unrealistic and possibly harmful. Opera singers simply cannot make a sound big enough to fill a large theater or concert hall without a microphone if their bod weight is too low. Emphasizing physical appearance over singing ability may cause audiences to miss out on the human voice at its best. ||| Effect of world finance on opera
